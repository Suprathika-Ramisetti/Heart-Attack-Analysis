**Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and predict the likelihood of heart attacks using patient health data. It applies data science techniques such as data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models to identify key risk factors and predict outcomes.

**Features**

1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on heart disease datasets

2.Identification of key risk factors using correlation and visualizations

3.Predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees

4.Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

**Technologies Used**

-Python

-Pandas, NumPy

-Matplotlib, Seaborn

-Scikit-learn

-Jupyter Notebook

**How to Run**

1.Clone the repository

  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-attack-analysis.git

  cd heart-attack-analysis

2.Install dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Run the notebook
